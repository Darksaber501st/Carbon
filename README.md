*A fun little satellite-image processing app*

A web application for assessing green-vegetation change (i.e., change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or "NDVI") over user-selected geographic areas through analyzing satellite imagery data from NASA's MODIS instrument. 

I put together the weekend of Dec 20-22nd, 2024 as part of my application for "GIS Sr Principal Data Scientist" at Oracle, so you can understand what I can do. Admittedly, I'm relatively basic at my web frontend skills so I built it with a fair bit of AI help and it isn't "refined" as of yet, but it is mostly functional. The backend (downloading and analyzing satellite data) is something I've done many times previously, happy to give you better examples.

This app allows users to select areas of interest, submit analysis jobs, automatically pulls relevant data from NASA's backend, processes it, and eventually displays it in a web visualization.

You can see a demo live at https://gis.jariz.dev (username: "oracle", password: "please_interview_me"; I disabled the submit-job functionality for security reasons, happy to turn it back on if you email me)
